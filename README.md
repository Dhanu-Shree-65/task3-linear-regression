Linear Regression - AI & ML Internship

This repository contains the implementation of **simple and multiple linear regression** using the Housing Price Prediction dataset. This task was completed as part of the AI & ML Internship Program.
 Objective

To build and evaluate a regression model that predicts housing prices based on multiple features using Scikit-learn.

 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

 Steps Followed

1. Imported and explored the dataset.
2. Preprocessed categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a `LinearRegression` model using Scikit-learn.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
6. (Optional) Plotted regression line for visual understanding.

Evaluation Results

Model evaluation metrics are printed at the end of the notebook.
